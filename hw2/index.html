		<h2>Task1: </h2>
		<p>
			De Casteljau's algorithm is a algorithm that using input control points and parameter t to recursively generate intermediate points until there is only one points left.
			Here, we implemented one step of Bezier curve such that we used the provided n control points to generate n-1 intermediate points. 
			Specifically, we linear interpolate every two adjacent control points to find a intermediate point. 
			By recursively calling evaluateStep function, we will be able to finish the algorithm and generates the curve.

		<h2>Task2: </h2>
		<p>
			Applying De Casteljau's algorithm to evaluate Bezier surface includes multiple steps. 
			Having the input grid and parameters <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>, we first creates Bezier curve on each row of the input grid with parameter <code>u</code>.
			By doing so, we will have a point for every bezier curve created and we put all of them in a vector and evaluate with parameter <code>v</code>.
			To implement this, we used <code>evaluateStep</code> and <code>evaluate1D</code> as helper function for <code>evaluate</code>.
			<code>evaluateStep</code> is basically same as the function in task1, and in <code>evaluate1D</code> we recursively calls <code>evaluateStep</code> to generate one point for the Bezier curve.
			Lastly, in <code>evaluate</code>, we calls <code>evaluate1D</code> for every row and calls it again for the vector that contains all the bezier curve.

		<h2>Task3:</h2>
		<p>
			Since we were given the vertex, we first get its halfedge h. Then, we loop around all the faces of this vertax by calling <code>h->twin()->next()</code> until we reach the halfedge again.
			Within each iteration, we were able to get the two vector of the other two edges in triangle by calling <code>h->next()->vertex()->position - h->vertex()->position;</code> and <code>h->next()->next()->vertex()->position - h->vertex()->position</code>.
			Then, we take the cross product of the two edges to get the normal vector to current face and added to the <code>sum</code> vector.
			By doing so, we can get the sum of all normal vectors to triangles that this vertax is in.
			Lastly, we normalize the <code>sum</code> vector and returns.

		<h2>Task4:</h2>
		<p>
			I implemented edge flip operation based on the screenshot below. I first obtained all of the half edges, vertices, edges, and faces before flipping. 
			Then according to what the triangle mesh should look like after flipping in the screenshot, I reassigned edges, vertices, edges, and faces. 
			I think one interesting thing is that the pointers should be assigned carefully. I encountered a bug related to missing triangle when implementing, 
			and it was due to incorrect pointer assignment. So I think the debugging trick I found most useful was simply being careful with pointers.

		<h2>Task5:</h2>
		<p>
			I implemented edge split operation following a similar approach to task 4. 
			I first obtained all of the half edges, vertices, edges, and faces before flipping. 
			Then I added one new vertex m, three new edges, and six new half edges resulting from the edge splitting operation. 
			Similar to task 4, I reassign pointers if needed. 
			My implementation does not involve deleting elements from the origin triangle mesh in order to avoid segmentation faults due to problematic pointer removals. 
			My debugging approach is similar to that I mentioned in task 4.

		<h2>Task6:</h2>
		<p>
			I implemented the loop subdivision following the instructions on the spec and comments in the upsample function. 
		   	I first computed new positions for all the vertices in the input mesh, using the Loop subdivision rule (u=3/16 if n=3, 3/(8n) otherwise), and stored them in Vertex::newPosition. 
		   	For step 2, I computed the updated positions for the midpoints of edges (3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)) and stored them in Edge::newPosition. Then I created a list to track original edges because the mesh.edges list will be modified in the splitting process.
			For step 3, I splitted every edge in the mesh and update the new vertices' positions, marking the “isNew” attribute of new edges created in this process as true. 
			For step 4, Flip any new edge that connects an old and new vertex. 
			For step 5, I copied the new vertex positions into the Vertex::position and reset “isNew” for the next iteration of subdivision. 
			I did not encounter any bugs when implementing task 6, so I cannot really say which debugging trick I found most useful. 
			
			Sharp corners in the original mesh tend to become smoother and less pronounced with each iteration of Loop subdivision. This is because the algorithm averages the positions of the vertices, which naturally rounds off sharp angles. 
			Similar to sharp corners, sharp edges also become smoother with Loop subdivision. The sharpness of an edge is reduced with each subdivision step, as new vertices are introduced along the edge and existing vertices are moved to average positions. 
			To reduce the smoothing effect on sharp features, one could pre-split or insert extra edges around the areas that are intended to remain sharp before applying the subdivision. This technique can help in maintaining some of the mesh's original sharpness by creating a localized increase in vertex density, which affects the averaging calculations during subdivision.
			I can pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically by splitting the single edge on every face of the cube.
