		<h2>Task1: </h2>
		<p>
			1. We first computed the boundary for the triangle by calculating the min and max value of X and Y for the three verices of the traingle.
			Then, we iterate through each points in the box, we define the pixel is inside the triangle if the center of the pixel is inside the triangle.
			For the point in triangle test, we compute the barycentric coordinate of the triangle to see if the point is inside. Lastly, we call fill in color for the point if it's inside the triangle.
			2. Our algorithm is no worse than checking each sample within the bounding box because we checked each point in the bounding box of the triangle but not every sample in the frame.
